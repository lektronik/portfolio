# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this is a personal portfolio and collection of projects, "supported versions" functionality applies primarily to the individual projects listed. Please refer to the specific repository of each project for its maintenance status.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects or this portfolio:

1.  **Do not** create a public GitHub issue.
2.  Please report it directly to me via email at [telis.aslanidis.io@gmail.com](mailto:telis.aslanidis.io@gmail.com).
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability and steps to reproduce it.

I will attempt to review and respond to valid security reports as soon as possible.
